Jupyter notebooks for chem 312L

This repo has several Jupyter notebooks for use in UMBC Chem 312L, second term physical chemistry lab. We do kinetics, spectroscopy, and computatational chemistry.

Descriptioni of notebooks:

model fitting lab
An experiment to show students how to fit a dataset to a model and determine goodness of fit.
The top portion of the notebook fits a sample dataset, walking students through techniques for cleaning up the data,
creating a model, fitting, extracting fit parameters, and plotting residuals.
The bottom portion of the notebook describes the lab students need to complete, where they'll fit
data from a Diet Coke and Mentos experiment.

graphing snippets
Some sample code to show students a variety of ways to fit a dataset.
